Koala
====
Koala (<a href="http://github.com/arsduo/koala" target="_blank">http://github.com/arsduo/koala</a>) is a new Facebook library for Ruby, supporting the Graph API, the old REST API, realtime updates, and OAuth validation.  We wrote Koala with four goals: 

* Lightweight: Koala should be as light and simple as Facebookâ€™s own new libraries, providing API accessors and returning simple JSON.  (We clock in, with comments, just over 500 lines of code.)
* Fast: Koala should, out of the box, be quick. In addition to supporting the vanilla Ruby networking libraries, it natively supports Typhoeus, our preferred gem for making fast HTTP requests. Of course, That brings us to our next topic:
* Flexible: Koala should be useful to everyone, regardless of their current configuration.  (We have no dependencies beyond the JSON gem.  Koala also has a built-in mechanism for using whichever HTTP library you prefer to make requests against the graph.)
* Tested: Koala should have complete test coverage, so you can rely on it.  (Our complete test coverage can be run against either mocked responses or the live Facebook servers.)

Graph API
----
The Graph API is the simple, slick new interface to Facebook's data.  Using it with Koala is quite straightforward: 
    graph = Koala::Facebook::GraphAPI.new(oauth_access_token)
    profile = graph.get_object("me")
    friends = graph.get_connection("me", "friends")
    graph.put_object("me", "feed", :message => "I am writing on my wall!")

Check out the wiki for more examples.

The old-school REST API
-----
Where the Graph API and the old REST API overlap, you should choose the Graph API.  Unfortunately, that overlap is far from complete, and there are many important API calls -- including fql.query -- that can't yet be done via the Graph.  

Koala now supports the old-school REST API using OAuth access tokens; to use this, instantiate your class using the RestAPI class:

	@rest = Koala::Facebook::RestAPI.new(oauth_access_token)
	@rest.fql_query(my_fql_query) # convenience method
	@rest.rest_call("stream.publish", arguments_hash) # generic version
	
We reserve the right to expand the built-in REST API coverage to additional convenience methods in the future, depending on how fast Facebook moves to fill in the gaps.  

(If you want the power of both APIs in the palm of your hand, try out the GraphAndRestAPI class.)

OAuth
-----
You can use the Graph and REST APIs without an OAuth access token, but the real magic happens when you provide Facebook an OAuth token to prove you're authenticated.  Koala provides an OAuth class to make that process easy:
    @oauth = Koala::Facebook::OAuth.new(app_id, code, callback_url)

If your application uses Koala and the Facebook [JavaScript SDK](http://github.com/facebook/connect-js) (formerly Facebook Connect), you can use the OAuth class to parse the cookies:
    @oauth.get_user_from_cookie(cookies)

And if you have to use the more complicated [redirect-based OAuth process](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/), Koala helps out there, too:
	# generate authenticating URL
	@oauth.url_for_oauth_code
	# fetch the access token once you have the code
	@oauth.get_access_token(code)

You can also get your application's own access token, which can be used without a user session for subscriptions and certain other requests:
    @oauth.get_app_access_token

That's it!  It's pretty simple once you get the hang of it.  If you're new to OAuth, though, check out the wiki and the OAuth Playground example site (see below).

*Exchanging session keys:* Stuck building tab applications on Facebook?  Wishing you had an OAuth token so you could use the Graph API?  You're in luck! Koala now allows you to exchange session keys for OAuth access tokens:
    @oauth.get_token_from_session_key(session_key)
    @oauth.get_tokens_from_session_keys(array_of_session_keys)

Real-time Updates
-----
The Graph API now allows your application to subscribe to real-time updates for certain objects in the graph.

Currently, Facebook only supports subscribing to users, permissions and errors.  On top of that, there are limitations on what attributes and connections for each of these objects you can subscribe to updates for.  Check the [official Facebook documentation](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api/realtime) for more details.

Koala makes it easy to interact with your applications using the RealTimeUpdates class:

    @updates = Koala::Facebook::RealTimeUpdates.new(:app_id => app_id, :secret => secret)

You can do just about anything with your real-time update subscriptions using the RealTimeUpdates class:

    # Add/modify a subscription to updates for when the first_name or last_name fields of any of your users is changed
    @updates.subscribe("user", "first_name, last_name", callback_token, verify_token)

    # Get an array of your current subscriptions (one hash for each object you've subscribed to)
    @updates.list_subscriptions

    # Unsubscribe from updates for an object
    @updates.unsubscribe("user")

And to top it all off, RealTimeUpdates provides a static method to respond to Facebook servers' verification of your callback URLs:

    # Returns the hub.challenge parameter in params if the verify token in params matches verify_token
    Koala::Facebook::RealTimeUpdates.meet_challenge(params, your_verify_token)

For more information about meet_challenge and the RealTimeUpdates class, check out the Real-Time Updates page on the wiki.

Some resources to help you as you play with Koala and the Graph API:

* Complete Koala documentation <a href="http://wiki.github.com/arsduo/koala/">on the wiki</a>
* The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/koala-users">Koala users group</a> on Google Groups, the place for your Koala and API questions
* The Koala-powered <a href="http://oauth.twoalex.com" target="_blank">OAuth Playground</a>, where you can easily generate OAuth access tokens and any other data needed to test out the APIs or OAuth

Testing
-----

Unit tests are provided for all of Koala's methods.  By default, these tests run against mock responses and hence are ready out of the box: 
    # From the spec directory
    spec koala_spec.rb

You can also run live tests against Facebook's servers:
    # Again from the spec directory
    spec koala_spec_without_mocks.rb

Important Note: to run the live tests, you have to provide some of your own data: a valid OAuth access token with publish\_stream and read\_stream permissions and an OAuth code that can be used to generate an access token.  You can get these data at the OAuth Playground; if you want to use your own app, remember to swap out the app ID, secret, and other values.  (The file also provides valid values for other tests, which you're welcome to swap out for data specific to your own application.)
