      # A client for the Facebook Graph API.
      # 
      # See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api for complete documentation
      # for the API.
      # 
      # The Graph API is made up of the objects in Facebook (e.g., people, pages,
      # events, photos) and the connections between them (e.g., friends,
      # photo tags, and event RSVPs). This client provides access to those
      # primitive types in a generic way. For example, given an OAuth access
      # token, this will fetch the profile of the active user and the list
      # of the user's friends:
      # 
      #    graph = Koala::Facebook::GraphAPI.new(access_token)
      #    user = graph.get_object("me")
      #    friends = graph.get_connections(user["id"], "friends")
      # 
      # You can see a list of all of the objects and connections supported
      # by the API at http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/.
      # 
      # You can obtain an access token via OAuth or by using the Facebook
      # JavaScript SDK. See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/
      # for details.
      # 
      # If you are using the JavaScript SDK, you can use the
      # Koala::Facebook::OAuth.get_user_from_cookie() method below to get the OAuth access token
      # for the active user from the cookie saved by the SDK.

        # 
        # writes "Hello, world" to the active user's wall. Likewise, this

        # 
        #     feed = graph.get_connections("me", "feed")

        # See http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api#publishing for all of
        # the supported writeable objects.
        #
